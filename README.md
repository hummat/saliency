# Saliency Methods
## Introduction
This repository contains code for the following saliency techniques:

* XRAI
* SmoothGrad
* Vanilla Gradients
* Guided Backpropogation
* Integrated Gradients
* Grad-CAM
    
## Examples
Please have a look at this short [iPython notebook]()

## Credits
The implementation follows closely that of the corresponding [TensorFlow saliency](https://github.com/PAIR-code/saliency) repository, reusing its code were applicable (mostly for the XRAI method).

Further inspiration has been taken from [this](https://github.com/utkuozbulak/pytorch-cnn-visualizations) repository.
